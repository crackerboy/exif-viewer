#EXIF Viewer/Learner thing

I spent a few hours one day having to read the EXIF spec. I modified the [Exif.js](https://github.com/exif-js/exif-js) lib to dump out details about how it interprets the binary and then made an interactive viewer.

All specs should be interactive. This is an attempt to make learning the EXIF spec easier.
